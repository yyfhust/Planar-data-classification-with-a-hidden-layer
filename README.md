Planar data classification with one hidden layer

Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment. It's time to build your first neural network, which will have a hidden layer. You will see a big difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression.

You will learn how to:

    Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
    Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
    Compute the cross entropy loss
    Implement forward and backward propagation
